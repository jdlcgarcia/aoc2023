![Advent of Code Banner](advent_of_code_banner.png)

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2023 Kotlin repository! This repository contains my Kotlin solutions for the challenges presented in the Advent of Code event for the year 2023.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual coding event that takes place in December. Each day, starting from December 1st to December 25th, a new programming challenge is released. The challenges cover a variety of algorithms and data structures, and participants are encouraged to solve them using their programming language of choice.

For more information and to participate in Advent of Code, visit [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Folder Structure

- Each day's challenge has its own Kotlin package named `dayN` where N is the day number.
- Inside each day's package, you'll find the input data (`input.txt`) and the Kotlin source code (`Solution.kt`).

## Running the Solutions

1. Navigate to the day's Kotlin package you want to explore.
2. Review the `README.md` file within each day's package for specific details about the challenge.
3. Run the solution code using Kotlin's standard tools or your preferred IDE.
4. Or execute the following command for the day XX

```bash
make runXX
```
