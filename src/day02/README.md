## Solution

This one looked more like a typical "early day" of AoC. I liked the parsing and how you can avoid using regex, also it's something very common to find in real life coding. The second part only needed a few tweaks and a calculation because I learnt the wrong lesson by stopping as early as possible in the loop.
