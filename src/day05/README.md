## Solution

Oh my... this is one of those exercises where parsing the input is more tedious than the exercise itself... The input is not that large, so I will try to skip that part of the process...

Skipping done, too bad I didn't versioned or copied the test data... but well, I liked the approach I did!! I thought using such big numbers would have made the execution take longer... but it worked nicely! I will definitely make it in PHP too and compare times ;)
