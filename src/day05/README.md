## Solution

Oh my... this is one of those exercises where parsing the input is more tedious than the exercise itself... The input is not that large, so I will try to skip that part of the process...

Skipping done, too bad I didn't versioned or copied the test data... but well, I liked the approach I did!! I thought using such big numbers would have made the execution take longer... but it worked nicely! I will definitely make it in PHP too and compare times ;)

The second part it's taking forever... I can hear the laptop's fan whirring :P I'm sure there's a smarter solution than doing insane calculations, but I can't think on it, since just a number variation would change the result. Maybe, and I'm thinking out loud, all those translation functions can be reduced from the end to the beginning, so you could find the location with just a sum instead of that many sums... I'll try to crush my brain a little bit, while the computer makes its brute force task
